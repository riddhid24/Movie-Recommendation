# Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering.

## Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- User-Item Matrix and Similarity Calculation
- Movie Recommendations
- Evaluation with RMSE
- Data Visualization
- Data Cleaning and Handling

## Instructions
1. Download the dataset files (`tmdb_5000_credits.csv` and `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`).
2. Run the code to generate movie recommendations and evaluate the model.
3. View data visualizations for movie ratings, genres, and budgets.
4. Optionally, save the cleaned data to a new CSV file.
